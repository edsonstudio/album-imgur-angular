# Album Imgur Angular

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 17.2.2.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.jsÂ®` and an `npm` package manager.

Angular requires a current, active LTS, or maintenance LTS version of Node.js. We recommend version **18.13.0** as the minimum version to run this project.

To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.

To get `Node.js`, go to nodejs.org.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Karma.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
